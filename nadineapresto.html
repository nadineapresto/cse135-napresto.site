    <p>Hi! I'm Nadine (pronounced as Nuh-deen) and I'm a 4th year Computer Science Student at UCSD! I specifically have an interest in web development and UX/UI. 
    <p>My other interests include cozy adventure/sandbox games such as Terraria, Luma Island, and Minecraft. I also enjoy playing games such as GTA V Online, Peak, and Roblox with my friends.</p>
    <p>When studying, doing schoolwork, or just driving around, I love to listen to music artists like SAILORR, Yeat, Don Toliver, The Sundays, Omar Apollo, and Clairo. I like all musical genres!</p>
    <p>I spend a lot of time with my family and friends! I'm the second oldest child in a family of 6! I have an older sister, a younger brother, and a younger sister. This past weekend, my family and I went to Mammoth Mountain for my parents' 26th wedding anniversary! I had lots of fun in the snow, I've never seen so much of it before!</p>

    <p>Here are some pictures from Mammoth!</p>
